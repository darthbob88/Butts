## Step 1.2 Install Homebrew and .NET Core

If you already have .NET Core installed on your machine, skip this step. 

Install .NET Core by downloading the **[official installer](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/F/D/0FD852A4-7EA1-4E2A-983A-0484AC19B92C/dotnet-sdk-2.0.0-osx-gs-x64.pkg)**. This installer will install the tools and put them on your PATH so you can run dotnet from the Console.
