> In this section, you will get SQL Server 2017 on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). After that you will install the necessary dependencies to create .NET Core apps with SQL Server.

## Step 1.1 Install SQL Server
{% include partials/install_sql_server_linux_sles.md %}

## Step 1.2 Install .NET Core

If you already have .NET Core installed on your machine, skip this step. Otherwise, install it using the following commands.

```terminal
sudo zypper install libunwind libicu
curl -sSL -o dotnet.tar.gz https://aka.ms/dotnet-sdk-2.0.0-linux-x64
mkdir -p ~/dotnet && tar zxf dotnet.tar.gz -C ~/dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet
```

> You have successfully installed .NET Core on your SLES machine. You now have everything you need to start writing your C# apps with SQL Server!
