<!--Migrate-->

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. 
Migrating data is a bulk-load operation that moves rows of data into SQL Server or SQL Azure in transactions. The number of rows to be loaded into SQL Server or SQL Azure in each transaction is configured in the project settings.

### Steps

To use SSMA for Access to migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1. Make sure you have **loaded the Access database objects** into Azure SQL Database

2. In Access Metadata Explorer, select the objects that contain the data that you want to migrate
    
    i. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name.
    ii. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand Tables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box.
    
3. Right-click Databases and then select Migrate Data
