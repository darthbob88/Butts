<!-- Process Overview -->

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project â€“ a solid methodology is required for success. When planning a migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic:

Each phase in the migration process is briefly described in the following table:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Discover | Database asset inventory and application stack discovery. |
|Assess | Workload assessment and recommended fixes. |
|Convert | Conversion of source schema to work in the target environment. |
|Migrate  | Migration of data to the target environment. |
|Remediate Applications | Iterative updates to applications to accommodate necessary changes. |
|Perform Tests | Iterative testing to confirm functionality and performance. |
|Optimize | After data and schema migration, testing the target environment to identify potential performance issues. |
|Sync Data | Post migration data sync and schema sync. |
|Cutover | Post migration rollback strategy planning. |

For more detail on a specific phase, see the Pre-Migration, Migration, and Post-Migration steps.
