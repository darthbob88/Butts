<!--Perform Tests-->

After the data is migrated to target, perform tests against the databases to verify that the applications perform well against the after the migration.
Use the Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) to assist with evaluating the target SQL Server. 

### Steps

To use DEA for database migration testing, perform the following steps.

1. **Download the [DEA tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54090)**, and then install it.

2. **Run a trace capture**

    a. On the left navigation tree, select the camera icon the go to **All Captures**.

    b. To start a new capture, select **New Capture**.
    
    c. To configure the capture, speficy the trace name, duration, SQL Server instance name, database name, and the share location for storing the trace file on the computer running SQL Server.

    d. Select **Start** to begin trace capture.

3. **Run a trace replay**
    
    a. On the left navigation tree, select the play icon the go to **All Replays**.

    b. To start a new replay, select **New Replay**.
    
    c. To configure the replay, specify the replay name, controller machine name, path to source trace file on controller, SQL Server instance name, and the pathfor storing the target trace file on the computer running SQL Server.
    
    d. Select **Start** to begin replay of your capture.
    
 4. **Create a new Analysis Report**
 
    a. On the left navigation tree, select the checklist icon to go to **Analysis Reports**.

    b. Connect to the SQL Server on which you will store your report databases.
    
    You will see the list of all reports in the server.
    
    c. Select **New Report**.
    
    d. To configure the report, specify the report name, and specify paths to the traces fon the source and target SQL Server instances.

 5. **Review an analysis report**
 
    a. On the first page of the report, the version and build information for the target servers on which the experiment was run displays.
    
    Threshold allows you to adjust the sensitivity or tolerance of your A/B Test analysis. 
    
    Note: By default, threshold is set to 5%; any performance improvement that is >= 5% is categorized as ‘Improved’. The drop-down selector allows you to evaluate the report using different performance thresholds.

    b. Select the individual slices of the pie chart to view drill-down metrics on performance.
    
    ![Drill down report](https://mpbdevcontent.azureedge.net/Images/deachart.png)
    
    On the drill-down page for a performance change category, you will see a list of queries in that category.

    c. Select an individual query to get performance summary statistics, error information, and query plan information.
