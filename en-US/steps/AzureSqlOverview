<!--Process Overview-->

Migrations should be approached with the same rigor and processes as a full software or hardware project â€“ a  solid methodology is required for success. When planning a migration project, we recommend that you consider the process shown in the following graphic:

Each phase in the data migration process is briefly described in the following table:

|**Phase** |**Description** |
|:---------|:---------------|
|Discover | Inventory database assets, and application stack discovery. |
|Assess | Assess workloads and fix recommendations. |
|Migrate  | Source schema needs to be converted to work in target. Migration of data to target. |
|Remediate Applications | Iterative process of making necessary changes to applications. |
|Perform Tests | Iterative process of executing functional and performance tests. |
|Optimize | Post data and schema migration, the target needs to be tested to identify performance issues. |
|Sync Data | Data Sync and schema sync post migration. |
|Cutover | Rollback strategy and plans post migration. |

For more detail on a specific phase, see the Pre-Migration, Migration and Post-Migration steps.
