<!--Migrate-->

After deploying your schema, the next step is to execute the data migration to Azure SQL Database. 

### Steps

To use SSMA for Oracle to publish the database schema and migrate the data, perform the following steps.

1. **Publish the schema to Azure SQL Database**.

    a. After schema conversion you can save this project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. You can do so by choosing "Save Project" from the "File" menu. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to Azure SQL Database.

    b. To Publish the schema, select the database from the "Databases" node in the "SQL Azure Metadata Explorer" and choose "Synchronize with Database" from the right-click menu options

    c. This action will publish the Oracle schema to the Azure SQL instance.

2. **Migrate data to Azure SQL Database**.

    a.	After publishing the schema to the Azure SQL instance, select the Oracle schema from the "Oracle Metadata Explorer‚Äù and choose "Migrate Data" from the right-click menu options or the menu bar on the top.
  
    b.	At this step you will be required to provide connection details for Oracle and Azure SQL in their respective connection dialogs to migrate the data.

    c. After the migration is complete you will be able to view the "Data Migration report".

    d. Validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema on the Azure SQL instance by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

SSMA is not the only option for migrating data, though. You could also use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
