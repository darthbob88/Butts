<!-- Assess & Convert -->

After identifying the data sources, the next step is to assess the Oracle instance(s) migrating to SQL Server database(s) so that you understand the gaps between the two.

By using the SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle, you can review database objects and data, assess databases for migration, migrate database objects to SQL Server, and then migrate data to SQL Server. 

### Steps

To use SSMA for Oracle to create an assessment, perform the following steps.

1. **Download [SSMA(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54258)**, and then install it.

2. Create a new **Assessment project** to discover the conversion rate and effort to resolve any issues.

   a. On **File** menu, select **New Project**, specify the project name, a location to save your project, and the migration target.
   
   _Selecting the migration target is important to accurately assess the conversion rate and effort._
  
   b. Select **OK**.

   c. Select **Connect to Oracle**, provide the connection details, and then select **Connect**.

   d. In the **Oracle Metadata Explorer**, select the Oracle schema, and then select **Create Report** to create the conversion report.

    This will generate an HTML report with conversion statistics and error/warnings, if any.
     
   e. Analyze this report to understand any conversion issues and their cause.

   You can also access this report from the SSMA projects folder as selected in the first screen.
   
   f. From the example above locate the report.xml file from 
   
   <drive:>\Users\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyOracleMigration\report\report_2016_11_12T02_47_55\
   
   and then open it in Excel to get an inventory of Oracle objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions.
   
3. **Perform schema conversion**.

   a. Before you perform schema conversion, validate the default datatype mappings or change them based on requirements.
   
   You could do this either by navigating to the **Tools** menu and selecting **Project Settings** or by changing the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in the **Oracle Metadata Explorer**.

   You can add dynamic or ad hoc queries to the **Statements** node by selecting that node and then selecting **Add Statement** on the right-click menu.
   
   b. To convert and move the schema to SQL Server, connect to the SQL server instance by providing the connection details in the **Connect to SQL Server** dialog box.
   
   You can choose to connect to an existing database or provide a new name, in which case a database will be created on the target server.

   c.	Convert the schema by selecting **Convert Schema** from the right-click menu or the menu bar on the top.

   d.	After schema conversion, compare and review the structure of the schema to identify potential problems.
